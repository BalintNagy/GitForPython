    House data
    
    Stephan and Sophia forget about security and use simple datas for
    everything. Help Nikola develop a data security check module. The
    data will be considered strong enough if its length is greater than
    or equal to 10 symbols, it has at least one digit, as well as containing
    one uppercase letter and one lowercase letter in it. The data contains
    only ASCII latin letters or digits.
    
    Input: A data as a string.
    
    Output: Is the data safe or not as a boolean or any data type that can
    be converted and processed as a boolean. In the results you will see the
    converted results.
    
    Example:
     checkio('A1213pokl') == False
     checkio('bAse730onE') == True
     checkio('asasasasasasasaas') == False
     checkio('QWERTYqwerty') == False
     checkio('123456123456') == False
     checkio('QwErTy911poqqqq') == True
    
    How it is used: If you are worried about the security of your app or service,
    you can check your users' datas for complexity. You can use these skills
    to require that your users datas meet more conditions (punctuations or
    unicode).
    
    Precondition:
     re.match("[a-zA-Z0-9]+", data)
     0 < len(data) â‰¤ 64
