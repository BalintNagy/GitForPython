    9. Fizz Buzz
       
       "Fizz buzz" is a word game we will use to teach the robots about division.
       Let's learn computers.
       
       You should write a function that will receive a positive integer and
       return:
        # "Fizz Buzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and by 5;
        # "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3;
        # "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5; 
        # The number as a string for other cases.

       Input: A number as an integer.

       Output: The answer as a string.

       Example:
       
        checkio(15) == "Fizz Buzz"
        checkio(6) == "Fizz"
        checkio(5) == "Buzz"
        checkio(7) == "7"
       
       How it is used: Here you can learn how to write the simplest function and
       work with if-else statements.
       
       Precondition: 0 < number â‰¤ 1000
